Therefore, it is important to consider the limitations of AI in this context and prioritize the value of human expertise in providing tailored feedback to students.","Teachers should be using generative AI tools to create interactive teaching materials and high quality materials that go beyond traditional text and images. AI-generated images can be tailored to match specific requirements and effectively convey emotions and concepts. By incorporating animation, short videos, and high-quality graphics, students are more likely to grasp and retain information for a longer period of time. These engaging and visually stimulating elements have proven to be more memorable and effective in conveying complex ideas compared to text alone. Therefore, leveraging AI to generate interactive content can enhance the learning experience and facilitate better comprehension among students.","implementing AI in universities can bring several benefits. It can automate administrative tasks, analyze data for insights, provide immediate student support, somewhat cheaper for students and optimize resources. These advantages contribute to increased efficiency and improved student experiences in the university setting.",2023-05-12

For example if asked a question about mechanics in a card game like poker, yugioh or bridge,  it will often confuse specialist terms with separate wholly different meanings or ignore wider rules, the sentences are legible but the intricacies are not adhered to. this has been more widely documented within chess, where AI softwares will know all the rules and still not adhere to them after a position presents slight complexities. I also think there is a fairly clear structure to the way AI structure sentences when answering questions, along with obvious giveaway phrasing such as the overuse of the words ""this suggests"" and constant reference to the fact that the information should not be taken as guaranteed and that a specialist must be consulted. there is also the obvious issue of referencing which many AI's struggle with, particularly chatgpt. Finally, i personally have too much pride to rely solely on something that isn't me for my work, i like the feeling of being unique/ being the first person to explore something or phrase it in a certain way.
